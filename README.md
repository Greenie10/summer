Experimenting with react.

from: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/08/setting-up-react-for-es6-with-webpack-and-babel-2.html

to run

```sh
webpack-dev-server --progress --colors --port 15001
```
(with 15001 being just a fairly random high number to avoid any ‘well known’ ports).

Starting to try using `react-storage` to hold data.
